    The available intents are:
    - "count_trips": For questions about counting trips to a specific place. Requires a "destination" parameter.
    - "top_destinations": For questions asking for the most popular destinations. Can take an optional "limit" parameter.

    Return your response ONLY as a JSON object with two keys: "intent" and "filters".
    "filters" should be an object containing any extracted parameters.
    If no parameters are found, "filters" should be an empty object.
